                <p>I'm a junior high school student.</p>
                <p>I'm interested in programming, sports, anime, English and so on.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            To show myself to the public.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>
                                To upload some interesting programs.
                            </strong>
                            I've learned C++ for more than two years, and I wanna upload some simple programs here.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>
                                To learn more about programming.
                            </strong>
                            Even though I've learnt some of it, there's still a long way to go.
                            Therefore, I hope I can improve my programming skills by setting up the website.
                        </p>

                                To improve my English.
                            </strong>
                            I've made up my mind to set up the website in English. I hope I can learn more advanced vocabularies in this way.
